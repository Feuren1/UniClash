## Tech information

All of the used components where required to be used by our Module assignment.

 - The frontend was mainly done in Kotlin using Jetpack composed which was quite nice to use even though it is not specifically made for games it still fit nicely to our needs.

 - The connection to the backend is done via Retrofit and Gson

 - The backend was generated for us using LoopBack4 which created NodeJs files 

 - The backend as well as the Database were hosted on a server on Render.com
